🧠 AI Agent – Boot.dev Project
This project is an AI-powered command-line assistant built as part of my learning path on Boot.dev, focused on practical, backend-oriented programming with AI integration.

💡 Features
This agent uses the Gemini API to understand user prompts and perform tasks in a loop, deciding when to respond with text or call a tool (function). It supports:

- 📁 List files and directories
Retrieves files and subdirectories from a given path (within the working directory).

- 📄 Read file contents
Displays the contents of specified files using a secure sandboxed approach.

- 🧪 Execute Python files
Runs scripts (like tests.py) and captures their standard output.

- ✍️ Write or overwrite files
Creates or modifies files with content generated by the LLM.

⚙️ How it works
Uses the google.genai SDK to integrate with the Gemini 2.0 model.
Implements function calling via types.FunctionDeclaration and types.Content.
Maintains conversation state with a list of messages, looping until the task is resolved.
Verbose mode (--verbose) shows token usage, function calls, and their outputs.

📦 Example usage
``` 
uv run main.py "get the contents of README.md"
uv run main.py "run tests.py" --verbose
uv run main.py "create a new file called hello.txt with the contents 'Hi there!'"
```

🎓 Learning Outcomes
- Safe execution and file handling in Python.
- Prompt engineering and iterative LLM design.
- CLI interface design with argparse and environment variables.
- Building a loop-based AI agent with real-world utility.
